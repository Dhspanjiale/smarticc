Drones. Everyone has heard of them before. Some play with them, some use them to take beautiful pictures, some even use them to send packages! In this day and age, what do drones have to offer for us in the future?

## **What are drones?**

A drone is also known as an unmanned aerial vehicle. It flies in the air. They can be controlled by humans with the use of code, or via a controller.

## **Technology used to make drones**

Drones are equipped with infra-red cameras (military UAV), GPS and laser (military UAV). They are controlled by a remote control system also sometimes referred to as a ground cockpit. This system has two parts, the drone itself and the control system. The drone technology covers the aerodynamics of the drone, materials which made the drone, circuit boards in them and finally, the chipset and the software which provides function to the drones. Flight of drones is technology derived from our smartphones. These drones have undergone many generations, where each generation improves the overall design and functionality of the drones. Currently, the technology has reached generation 7. 

## **How are drones made**

Drones are made of many different parts, 	namely the drone body, the propeller, batteries and a receiver. The drone body is mostly made of light composite materials, while the propellers (most of the time more than 4) are used to generate lift for the drone, enabling it to fly. Big, but light batteries are required for the drone to fly without being connected by a cable, and the receiver is used to send commands to the drone to control its flight

## **Advantages and Disadvantages of drones**

Drones are convenient to use and drone usage saves a lot of time and energy, especially in the case of for example transferring packages. Drones also help against many human limitations, for example pictures from high angles of view. 

On the other hand, in terms of other countries or even Singapore, drones may get attacked by animals or birds (in rare cases). Drones may also be hacked by hackers and taken advantage of.

## **How they are currently being used now and how they can be used in the future**

Drones are being used widely by both the public and economic world and may be further implemented in industries like sports, tourism, manufacturing and more. In Singapore, they have also been used for entertainment, like the dancing drones display at Gardens By the Bay for Singapore NDP 2017.
