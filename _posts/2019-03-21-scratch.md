# **Scratch Is The Future Of Programming**

Scratch is an open source system that enables individuals to program interactive stories, games and animations. Scratch is an ideal tool for teaching kids how to code.

While there may be many different programming languages, they all require typing codes that most people do not understand. However, one particular innovation that will change this is [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/).

The method of using visual blocks to create programs is the future of programming. Here is why: 
 
### 1.  **Scratch does NOT require syntax**
In order to build your own program, all you have to do is move blocks around. It is manipulated through visual means rather than by typing code. Visual blocks are more self-explanatory as they use English. While today's development tools include features to help reduce typing mistakes, such as autocomplete, sometimes developers still spend hours debugging on a simple typo.

### 2.  **Scratch can be used to create sophisticated programs**
It's not just for kids! There are many building blocks to choose from to create complex programming. if you explore the tools in more detail, you will find that there are many other blocks available. To send messages from one Sprite (an object in Scratch) to another compared to how many codes you need to learn in order to send a message in Windows 3.1. But with Scratch, you can do the same thing by using just two blocks!

### 3.  **Scratch is extensible**
Many Scratch users may not realize they can add variables, list and even create their own blocks in the program! Users can even connect Scratch to hardware such as PicoBoard and LEGO WeDo. This extensible is really makes the possibility endless.

Scratch is an ideal tool for teaching kids how to code. All the material is free and there are many resources to help teachers integrate coding with their curriculum. 
Explore some of the millions of programs created with **Scratch** at [scratch.mit.edu](scratch.mit.edu) and try the website for yourself.
