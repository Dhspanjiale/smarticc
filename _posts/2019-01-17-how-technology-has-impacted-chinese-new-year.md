## Greetings and Communications

Greetings between family members and friends are an important tradition of Chinese New Year. However, the improvement in technology has impacted the way we communicate with our loved ones. For those who are unable to reunite with their family, the greetings are usually communicated through telephones and SMSs in the past, causing the systems of many telecom service providers to crash. However, now the burden has been reduced as we can easily send our best wishes to family and friends through different instant messaging applications.
