Artificial Intelligence. You may have heard of this term lately but what exactly is artificial intelligence and what does it have to do with modern-day society? Let’s talk more about it.

AI (artificial intelligence) is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. Particular applications of AI include expert systems, speech recognition and machine vision. Artificial Intelligence helps us perform the tasks in our day-to-day life, making decisions and completing our daily chores. Some benefits of Artificial Intelligence includes: 

- Freeing up Humans for what they do best
    - Humans are not best served by doing tedious tasks. Machines can do that, so this is where AI can provide a true benefit.

- Adds Jobs, Strengthens The Economy 
    - We all see the headlines: Robots and AI will destroy jobs. This is fiction rather than fact. AI encourages a gradual evolution in the job market which, with the right preparation, will be positive. People will still work, but they’ll work better with the help of AI. 
- Enhances Our Lifestyle
    - The rise of AI in our society will enhance our lifestyle and create more efficient businesses. Some of the mundane tasks like answering emails and data entry will be done by intelligent assistants.

You may be wondering, if Artificial Intelligence is so important and useful, why do I not see it frequently around me. Actually, Artificial Intelligence exists all around you and if you pay close enough attention, you might start to notice some of them in action...

Have you ever played video games? Most of the people would have. In every modern video game, all the characters have artificial intelligence which allows them to follow the main player, attack and fight automatically without human interaction.

Another famous example of artificial intelligence is fraud detection system. Many times we receive fake emails such as login to bank, credit card security, etc. These systems analyze emails and many banks have security methods which prevent theft of credit card details, etc.

So what now? How do I learn more about AI and its capabilities? Well, we have just the right thing for you.
