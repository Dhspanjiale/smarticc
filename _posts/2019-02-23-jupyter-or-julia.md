## Introduction to Jupyter

![][image-1]

Project Jupyter is a nonprofit organisation created to develop open-source software, open-standards, and services for interactive computing across dozens of programming languages. 
Users are able to code and share their work on this platform for free~

### The history behind this fascinating notebook… 

In 2014, **Fernando Pérez** (software developer/ free software advocate) created something called “IPython”, and later he announced a spin-off project from IPython called Project Jupyter. At the same time, IPython did not disappear, instead, it continued to exist as a Python shell and a kernel for Jupyter.

### An important concept: Open-source Software

It is a type of computer software in which source code is released under a license in which the copyright holder grants users the rights to study, change, and distribute the software to anyone and for any purpose. And according to Jupyter website: 

> Jupyter will always be 100% open-source software, free for all to use and released under the liberal terms of the modified BSD license.


### How to access Jupyter ???

There are 3 ways to access Jupyter Notebook :
1. Directly through your browser
2. Microsoft Azure Notebook
3. Install Jupyter on your laptop

### How to contribute ???

You can contribute by checking out the Jupyter Contributing guide. This contains information about the different projects in the Jupyter ecosystem.

### Is Jupyter and Julia related?

Jupyter is a platform for users to write and share their codes, while Julia is actually a high-level general-purpose dynamic programming language, it is supported on the Jupyter notebook.

## Then, what is Julia? 

Julia is designed to address the needs of high-performance numerical analysis and computational science. Started in 2009, Jeff Bezanson, Stefan Karpinski, Viral B. Shah, and Alan Edelman created a free language that was both high-level and fast. In 2012, the team launched a website with a blog post explaining the language's mission. Karpinski said of the name "Julia":

> There's no good reason, really. It just seemed like a pretty name.


Julia has attracted some high-profile clients, e.g. from investment manager BlackRock to the British insurer Aviva. 


-In August 2018, the number of downloads had reached 2,000,000.-
