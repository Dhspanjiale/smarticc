Though there are no official robot doctors or nurses, (we aren’t that smart yet) Singapore has come up with some innovative ideas to **educate the public about health and make checkups easier.** _Not so long ago, when going to a hospital, one had to bring a huge stack of identifications._ **Now it’s all in one app - HealthHub!**

Health hub was released in 2015, an online app that records your recent checkups and medical records (though the records are only recorded in a six months span)


### **_Features:_**

1. Health hub **features articles on keeping fit and in good trim.** They also include _articles on healthcare trends to keep people updated on the best health trends._ This helps to **_educate the general public on healthcare and spurs people to be in good shape._**

2. **Users of healthhub can gain health points from sharing articles mentioned above to social platforms _for the goodwill of others,_** _With sufficient health points, you could redeem them for shopping vouchers_....now that's something to look forward to. Especially if you are thrifty, earning vouchers for free by just sharing articles for the greater great? I'll take it!

3. Healthhub also **_tracks down your health records and all your checkup results._** The handy app also **reminds you of future checkups.** Want to know when your next appointment with the dentist is? That information is literally at your fingertips! _P.S.: if you have a senior adult at home, recommend this app to them. This app not only helps to track their personal records but also help remind them for their next appointments._

4. Healthhub users can **_access a directory of healthcare and lifestyle facilities and services available islandwide._** This includes locations of polyclinics, healthier eateries and sports facilities. Even healthhub is fair, their directories also show fast food restaurants. Even the healthiest crave for the fast food outlets. Of course, there's a catch: Only those fast food outlets from the Healthier Dining Program run by the Health Promotion Board. Kind of a rip-off but its a healthier option so no complaints!


### **_Cons:_**

1. As with all technologies nowadays, the programmes and the usage of healthhub may be intricate at first. Since the healthhub app is also targeted at senior citizens, the app may be too complex to understand.

2. Senior citizens may not have a smartphone to use the app. Senior citizens are senior hence they may not find a smartphone a preferable choice.

### **_What is the future for this app?_**

The healthhub app was released a few years ago and now many other apps have come up to serve the same purpose as healthhub. Admin matters have been taken into the patients' own hands. _In the near future, it is plausible to see a spike in the increase of this apps as their usefulness becomes more apparent to the public._ **This is an improvement to the convenience of the patients.** However, as we continue to advance into the deeper realms of technology, here's some food for thought, for you to ponder on the next time you see someone using related apps: 

1. With all these records handled by a single app, is there any use of human manpower? 

2. Before this splendid idea for healthhub came about, all medical records and appointments were handled by admins working in the hospital. With the superiority of these type of apps, would human manpower be expendable?
