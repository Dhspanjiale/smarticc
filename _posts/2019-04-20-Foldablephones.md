## **Are you amazed by what you saw above? You must be thinking,** _Foldable phones don't exist right?_ **WRONG!!! This is a picture of Samsung's newest phone, the _Galaxy Fold_. To those of you who already know what it is, please bear with us as we briefly introduce this device to the rest.**


## **Samsung's Galaxy Fold: What is it?**

The Samsung Galaxy Fold is a smartphone with a **4.6-inch (about 11.7cm)** cover display when folded, but it can unfold into a **7.3-inch (about 18.5cm) tablet**! The Galaxy Fold uses **multiple interlocking gears**, allowing the device to change from a phone to a _tablet_! The device will allow **three-app multi-tasking on the same screen** when used as a tablet! Isn't that amazing?

We can tell that all of you are now excited about this device. Now, let us tell you about another amazing feature of this phone!


## **The first 5G phone??**

Yes, you read the header right! There will be a 5G version of the device, making it the **first mainstream 5G phone**!!! If you wish to know more about 5G, click [here](https://dunmanhigh.github.io/smarticc/2018/07/13/5g-the-network-of-tomorrow) to read one of the past articles written by our very own students!


Now, we're pretty sure that when the device is made available in Singapore, most of you will rush to smartphone shops to get your hands on this device!

However, is it just us, or do we feel a sense of uneasiness here? Doesn't this seem a little **too good to be true**?

Well, you agree with us, then you are right.


## **The downfall of the Galaxy Fold**

After it was unveiled on 20 February, test models were given out for some users to try out. All seemed well until Bloomberg News, a popular news agency company, was given a test model of the Galaxy Fold. The review unit had **removed a plastic protective layer** on 15 April. However, by the following night, **a tear had developed at where the gadget opens**. Before long, the display **failed to operate properly**. There have been similar flaws reported such as **a small budge** appearing on the crease of the phone screen and the **inner display of the phone going dark**. Samsung is going to investigate the causes of the damaged Galaxy Fold, and hopefully, when the phone is made available in the United States this coming Friday (26 April), Samsung would have fixed this problem.


## **Not the first foldable smartphone?**

Even though, this may seem like the very first foldable smartphone, but it is **NOT**!!! The very first foldable smartphone was the **Royole FlexPai**, launched last year.

This phone has been getting many positive reviews from users. Looks like Samsung needs to step up their game, especially since Huawei and Xiaomi are expected to unveil their foldable handsets too at the end of this month!
